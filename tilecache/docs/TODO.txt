 * TileCache.Service: sand an HTTP 204 when not tiles are available (already
   done for the mod_python handler)
 * TileCache.Services.WMS, convert the file format if needed (with IE, the user
   will request the file as image/gif)
 * [done] move the ImageMerger classes into TileCache.Utils
 * Add a post-render-tile hook (can be used to optimize png files)
 * TileCache.Caches.AWSS3: add a local disk cache. should take the max-age into account.
   maybe a LRU with a max size or max object count.
